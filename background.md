# Revitalising Ayr Town Centre

Background: Lack of convenient car parking in Ayr (Scotland) may be having a detrimental impact on popularity of the town centre. This includes things like one way roads and car parking, and bottlenecks for accessing the town. 

Consequence: Flight of businesses, loss of amenities, activity centres etc. Depopulation of the city, especially families with children. 

Context: buildings reaching end of lifespan; 30 years of use. 

Solutions: More appealing amenities (e.g. but not exclusively retail and hospitality); socioeconomic anchors e.g. health centres.
