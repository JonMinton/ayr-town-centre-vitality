## Overview

The former Hourstons Building and former Arran Mall occupy a combined site on Alloway Street in Ayr town centre. The council report presented on 6 November 2025 recommends pivoting from a care village proposal to mixed-use residential development [@southayrshire2025hourstons].

## Site history

- **Hourstons** was a department store that traded for **123 years** before closing in **February 2019** with the loss of 81 jobs
- The adjacent **Arran Mall** shopping centre was largely emptied by 2022; subsequently purchased by South Ayrshire Council
- Combined site: approximately **5,800 m2** (2,600 m2 Hourstons + 3,200 m2 from Arran Mall demolition)
- The Hourstons building is **Category C listed** --- the original facade must be retained

## Failed plans --- a case study in institutional churn

This site illustrates the difficulty of town centre regeneration when plans keep changing:

1. **Pre-2022 (SNP-led council):** Convert to a new swimming pool and leisure centre. A design firm was appointed by 2021.
2. **Post-2022 (Conservative-led council):** Leisure centre plans scrapped. Replaced with a **"Living Well Village"** --- a care village with residential care, affordable housing, a day centre, and relocated NHS/HSCP offices. Phase 1 costed at GBP 20 million.
3. **November 2025:** Care village declared **no longer viable due to lack of funding**. Pivot to mixed-use residential development and potential disposal on the open market.

Three different plans in six years, none of which has broken ground. The site has deteriorated throughout.

## Current proposal

- Mixed-use residential development, potentially via disposal to a private developer or partnership arrangement
- A detailed report on residential options and tenure types is expected by **March 2026**
- Planning officers recommended reallocation of **GBP 11.26 million** for the site

## Policy significance

This is the site Ian MacLeod (community councillor) flagged as being "disposed of" to residential developers. It crystallises the central policy tension in this project.

The evidence gathered in this project --- particularly the [economic analysis](../../analysis/local-economy.qmd) and the [gravity model framework](../gravity-model-framework.qmd) --- argues against wholesale residential conversion:

- **The town centre is a jobs hub**, employing roughly three times more people than live there. Residential conversion would destroy this employment function.
- **Every unit of commercial floorspace converted to housing reduces the town centre's "destination mass"**, shifting the competitive balance toward Prestwick and accelerating a second vicious cycle of decline.
- **The council's residential pivot** is framed as a strategy to increase town centre living and footfall. But residential footfall is not the same as destination footfall --- people living above shops are not a substitute for people travelling to shops.

The failure of three successive plans over six years --- and the progressive deterioration of a prominent town-centre site --- is itself evidence of the vicious cycle this project hypothesises. The longer a prime site sits vacant, the harder it becomes to attract investment, and the more the surrounding area declines.

The site is in Ayr town centre proper, which is **south of the River Ayr** and therefore outside the Pride in Place programme's geographic boundary (see [Pride in Place summary](ref-pride-in-place.qmd)). PIP funding cannot be assumed for this site, though there may be scope to link town centre proposals conceptually to PIP-funded improvements north of the river.
