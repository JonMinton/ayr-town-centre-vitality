## Overview

The **Pride in Place Programme** is a major UK Government regeneration initiative announced in 2025, providing up to **GBP 20 million per neighbourhood over 10 years** to areas experiencing both high deprivation and weak social infrastructure [@ukgov2025prideinplace]. Nearly 250 neighbourhoods across Great Britain have been selected.

## Relevance to Ayr

South Ayrshire is one of 14 Scottish local authorities selected. The designated neighbourhood is the **"Northern Ayr and Town Centre Regeneration Corridor"** --- directly encompassing the area this project is investigating.

## Programme structure

- Funding is governed by locally established **Neighbourhood Boards** comprising community representatives, councillors, and local MPs
- Boards develop **10-year Regeneration Plans** and decide how investment is spent
- Funding begins from **April 2026**

## Eligible activities

- Revitalising high streets and town centres
- Preserving heritage
- Providing housing
- Creating jobs
- Improving transport links
- Boosting health and wellbeing

## Selection criteria

Neighbourhoods were selected based on the **Index of Multiple Deprivation** (IMD) and the **Community Needs Index**, confirming that the Ayr North area is among the most deprived in Scotland with the weakest social infrastructure.

## Policy significance

This is a substantial funding commitment that creates both an opportunity and a constraint for Ayr town centre planning. The programme's three strategic aims --- stronger communities, thriving places, empowered residents --- align closely with the theory of change outlined in this project (see [background](background.qmd)). Any redevelopment proposals for the town centre should be considered in the context of this funding stream.
