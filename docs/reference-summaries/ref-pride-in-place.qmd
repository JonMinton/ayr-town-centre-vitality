## Overview

The **Pride in Place Programme** is a major UK Government regeneration initiative announced in 2025, providing up to **GBP 20 million per neighbourhood over 10 years** to areas experiencing both high deprivation and weak social infrastructure [@ukgov2025prideinplace]. Nearly 250 neighbourhoods across Great Britain have been selected.

## Relevance to Ayr

South Ayrshire is one of 14 Scottish local authorities selected. The designated neighbourhood is the **"Northern Ayr and Town Centre Regeneration Corridor"**. Despite the name, the programme's geographic focus is on **Northern Ayr** --- the area immediately north of the River Ayr. The town centre proper (south of the river, where the commercial core and Burns Statue Square sit) falls outside the PIP boundary. There may be scope to link town centre developments conceptually to PIP-funded activity north of the river, but direct PIP funding for Ayr town centre in its everyday geographic sense should not be assumed.

## Programme structure

- Funding is governed by locally established **Neighbourhood Boards** comprising community representatives, councillors, and local MPs
- Boards develop **10-year Regeneration Plans** and decide how investment is spent
- Funding begins from **April 2026**

## Eligible activities

- Revitalising high streets and town centres
- Preserving heritage
- Providing housing
- Creating jobs
- Improving transport links
- Boosting health and wellbeing

## Selection criteria

Neighbourhoods were selected based on the **Index of Multiple Deprivation** (IMD) and the **Community Needs Index**, confirming that the Ayr North area is among the most deprived in Scotland with the weakest social infrastructure.

## Policy significance

This is a substantial funding commitment that creates both an opportunity and a constraint for planning in the wider Ayr area. The programme's three strategic aims --- stronger communities, thriving places, empowered residents --- align closely with the theory of change outlined in this project (see [background](../background.qmd)). However, the geographic limitation to Northern Ayr means that any optimism about PIP funding the town centre directly must be tempered. The programme's primary impact on the town centre will be indirect --- through improvements to the northern approaches and surrounding neighbourhoods that may increase footfall and connectivity.
