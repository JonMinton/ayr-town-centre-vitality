## The problem {.smaller}

{{< include ../_includes/theory-of-change.qmd >}}

## South Ayrshire is ageing fast

- **Median age 49.2** --- compared to Scotland's 41.8
- **5th oldest** of 33 council areas (32 councils + Scotland)
- **Old-age dependency ratio 4th highest** in Scotland
- Most similar areas: Scottish Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, Na h-Eileanan Siar

## Town centre deprivation

- Town centre datazones fall in the **bottom 20% nationally** for income deprivation
- Concentrated disadvantage across **income, employment, health, and housing** domains
- Deprivation clusters spatially --- **hot spots** around the town centre and immediately north

## The town centre is a jobs hub

- The town centre **employs roughly 3 times more people than live there**
- Retail and hospitality dominate, but health and education are significant anchors
- Converting to residential use would destroy this employment function

## The case for renaissance {.smaller}

The evidence supports **economic renaissance**, not residential surrender:

1. The town centre still functions as an employment hub
2. Health demand is concentrated nearby --- anchor health services in the town centre
3. Income deprivation is high but employment exists --- the issue is access and wages, not absence of jobs
4. Residential conversion removes the economic rationale for the town centre entirely
5. The investment window (Burns Statue Square + Pride in Place) targets precisely the right interventions

## The public transport penalty

## Transport infrastructure

## The A70 is the biggest barrier

- The A70 road **physically separates Ayr Railway Station from the town centre**
- Pedestrian crossings are sparse at exactly the point where foot traffic should flow
- Burns Statue Square project realigns the A70 and creates a pedestrian zone
- This is the **single most impactful intervention** identified in the evidence

## Key findings

{{< include ../_includes/key-findings.qmd >}}

## The investment window

- **Burns Statue Square** [@southayrshire2025burnsstatue]: GBP 16 million --- A70 realignment, pedestrian zone, shopfront improvements, active travel route to Prestwick Airport. Construction from summer 2026.
- **Pride in Place** [@ukgov2025prideinplace]: up to GBP 20 million over 10 years for "Northern Ayr and Town Centre Regeneration Corridor". Funding from April 2026.
- Together: a **once-in-a-generation opportunity** to break the vicious cycle at its most upstream point.

## Next steps

- Population trends over time (not just the current snapshot)
- Migration flows --- who is leaving and who is arriving?
- Vacancy rates and footfall data for the town centre
- Census 2022 deep dive --- household composition, economic activity
- Monitoring framework to track whether interventions are working
