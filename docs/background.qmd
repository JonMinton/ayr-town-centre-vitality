title: "Revitalising Ayr Town Centre"

# Background

Lack of convenient car parking in Ayr (Scotland) may be having a detrimental impact on popularity of the town centre. This includes things like one way roads and car parking, and bottlenecks for accessing the town.

Consequence: Flight of businesses, loss of amenities, activity centres etc. Depopulation of the city, especially families with children.

Context: buildings reaching end of lifespan; 30 years of use.

Solutions: More appealing amenities (e.g. but not exclusively retail and hospitality); socioeconomic anchors e.g. health centres.

# Theory of change

The core hypothesis is that poor access and infrastructure (parking, road layout) reduces footfall in the town centre, which in turn drives business closures and loss of amenities. This creates a vicious cycle: fewer amenities make the town less attractive, accelerating depopulation — particularly among younger families — which further reduces demand. An ageing and shrinking population then weakens the tax base and economic case for investment, deepening decline.

Proposed interventions aim to break this cycle at two points:

1. **Improve access and attractiveness** — making the town centre easier to reach and more appealing to visit, increasing footfall and supporting existing businesses.
2. **Anchor the population** — embedding essential services (e.g. health centres, community facilities) in the town centre so that it remains a hub of daily life regardless of retail trends.

# Aim of project

- Report and synthesise key demographics of Ayr in comparison with other similar places
    - Is Ayr ageing especially quickly?
    - Is Ayr passing a tipping point?
- Develop and test different ideas about how to revitalise the town centre

## Comparator places

To make demographic comparisons meaningful, Ayr should be benchmarked against towns selected on criteria such as:

- **Similar population size** — medium-sized Scottish towns (roughly 40,000–60,000)
- **Coastal/geographic similarity** — other Ayrshire or west-of-Scotland coastal towns
- **Economic profile** — towns with comparable reliance on retail and services in the town centre
- **Trajectory** — towns that have experienced similar decline, and (where possible) towns that have successfully reversed it

Candidate comparators might include places like Kilmarnock, Irvine, Dumfries, Perth, or Stirling, though the final selection should be guided by data availability and the specific questions being addressed.

## Data sources and indicators

Key datasets to draw on include:

**Demographics and population**

- NRS mid-year population estimates (age, sex, area)
- Scotland Census 2022 (detailed demographics, housing, economic activity)
- School roll data (as a proxy for families with children)
- GP registration data / migration flows

**Economic vitality**

- Business rates and vacancy rates for Ayr town centre
- Footfall data (if available from local council or BID)
- Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD)

**Built environment**

- Building condition surveys or age-of-stock data
- Planning applications and investment data

The choice of indicators should be tied to what "tipping point" means in practice — e.g. a threshold rate of vacancy, a demographic age-structure ratio, or a sustained rate of net out-migration.

# Suggested workflow

- Use modular .md or .qmd (quarto) files, which can be developed and potentially slotted into presentations, html files, pdf reports etc.
- Use Mermaid diagrams (supported natively in Quarto and GitHub markdown) for logic models, flowcharts, and causal diagrams
- Put the input files in md/ folder or similar
- Use .bib references in a refs/ folder
- Create word docs in _outputs/docx and ppt presentations in _outputs/pptx
- Also create excel workbooks where required in data/excel
