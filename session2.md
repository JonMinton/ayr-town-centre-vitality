## Where we are 

This is the second session of a multi session project. We are interested in understanding the problems and finding workable solutions to how to regenerate Ayr town centre in Scotland.

Our approach: Do some deep dives into specific types of evidence that can profile Ayr and South Ayrshire in terms of multi-dimensional problems. 

So far we have looked at the demographic challenge. For this we produced a .qmd report. We also have underlying R code.

## Where we want to get to 

We want to have a comprehensive set of resources for different audiences. Analysts, policy-makers, etc. 

## What we'll do next

We are interested in producing another similar report to the Demographics piece, but with the following focus 

- Sociodemographics
- Urban accessibility
- Local economy

Some notes from Ian, the community councillor who lives in the area: 


As for specificity, yes - Further to the Ayr/ South Ayrshire demographics you harvested and synthesised for us, let’s explore the economic case (or not - fingers crossed!) for surrendering Ayr town centre to warehousing senior citizens and problematic behaviour socially housed. 

Versus the alternative of attempting a renaissance of social (school, libraries, colleges), cultural (music, sport, art), and economic (service providers and retail and hospitality) 

With particular regard to literal routes to get there (roads). 

This is a perfect storm because my chairing of our town centre community council mid-week discovered that a large central prime vacant site in Ayr town centre is likely to be ‘disposed of’ to ‘residential’ developers
