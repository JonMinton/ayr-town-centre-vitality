The core hypothesis is that poor access and infrastructure reduces footfall in the town centre, which drives business closures and loss of amenities. This creates a vicious cycle: fewer amenities make the town less attractive, driving further loss of footfall and demand, which weakens the economic base and leads to further underinvestment in access infrastructure.

Proposed interventions aim to break this cycle at two points:

1. **Improve access and attractiveness** --- making the town centre easier to reach and more appealing to visit, increasing footfall and supporting existing businesses.
2. **Anchor essential services** --- embedding services (e.g. health centres, community facilities) in the town centre so that it remains a hub of daily life regardless of retail trends.
