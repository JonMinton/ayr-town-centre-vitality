- **South Ayrshire's median age is 49.2** compared to Scotland's 41.8, ranking it the 5th oldest of 33 areas
- **Old-age dependency ratio is the 4th highest** in Scotland, meaning proportionally more over-65s relative to the working-age population
- **Town centre datazones fall in the bottom 20% nationally** for income deprivation, with concentrated disadvantage across income, employment, health, and housing domains
- **The town centre employs roughly 3 times more people than live there**, functioning as a jobs hub rather than a residential area
- **Public transport users face 2--3 times longer travel times** than car drivers to the same services, systematically excluding the most deprived, bus-dependent populations
- **Burns Statue Square (GBP 16 million)** targets the town centre directly with A70 realignment and a pedestrian zone. **Pride in Place (up to GBP 20 million over 10 years)** funds regeneration in Northern Ayr, north of the River Ayr --- adjacent to but not within the town centre proper. Together they represent a significant investment window, though their geographic separation means they address different parts of the problem
